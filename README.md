# ToDoList

Title: ToDoList

Description: This exercise uses React and Babel to create an interactive ToDo list that keeps track of its current state. It dynamically adds and removes items for the todo list. 

How To Run: go to https://jmobarry.github.io/ToDoList/. Click on items to remove them from the list. Type in items in the box and press enter to add them to the todo list.

Roadmap: In the future I would like to edit this todolist to include numbered values or bullet points and update the clock to keep track of the time in live.
